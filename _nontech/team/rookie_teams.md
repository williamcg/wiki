{% include stub %}

A rookie team is a team which is competing in its very first FIRST
competition. Teams that existed at one point, then left FIRST for one or more
years before competing again are not considered rookies. Rookie teams are eligible for specific rookie awards, most notably the Rookie All Star Award, which, at many events, is an award that qualifies you for worlds.
